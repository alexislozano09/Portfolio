Welcome to my portfolio website, I'm a student of Cyber Security, Networking, and Digital Forensics, and I'm excited to showcase my progress on this platform.

This website is a form of recording and sharing my experiences and progress as I develop more skills and maybe inspire others who are interested in these fields.
